This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, start the docker compose to run the database:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The database is not exposed to the host machine by default but you can add a port mapping in the `docker-compose.yml` if you want to access it directly.

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deployment

We are using Docker Compose for deployment. To build and run the application, use the following command:

```bash
docker compose --profile production up
```

This will build and start both the web application (in production mode) and the PostgreSQL database.
The web application will be accessible at [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80).
